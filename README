0. Development Guide:
   If you want to build from source, follow these steps, otherwise skip this section.

   1) Install the SoM sdk.sh to the path you choose or default. Suppose SDKPATH.
   2) Run "./build.sh ${SDKPATH}" to build the somapp application.
   3) The build process in 2) will produce a rpm package SoMApp-1.0.1-1.aarch64.rpm under build/, upload to the board,
      and run "rmp -ivh --force ./AIbox_aa2-1.0.1-1.aarch64.rpm" to update install.


1. File structure:
    The application is installed as:
        Binary File: => /opt/xilinx/bin
                                        aibox_aa2                               main app

        configuration File: => /opt/xilinx/share/ivas/aibox_aa2
                                        ped_pp.json                 Config of preprocess for refinedet.
                                        refinedet.json              Config of refinedet.
                                        crop.json                   Config of cropping for reid.
                                        reid.json                   Config of reid.
                                        draw_reid.json              Config of final results drawing.

2. The accelerated application (AA) firmware consist of bitstream, device tree overlay (dtbo) and xclbin
   file. The AA firmware is loaded dynamically on user request once Linux is fully booted. The xmutil utility can be used
   for that purpose.

   a) To list the available AA applications, run:

        xmutil listapps

      You should see similar output to this:

        Accelerator,     Type,   Active
        kv260-aa2,       flat,   0
        kv260-aa1,       flat,   0

      The Active column shows which AA is currently loaded in the system. It will change to 1 after the
      firmware is loaded.

   b) To load the AA1 application firmware consisting of PL bitstream, device tree overlay and xclbin,
      run the following command:

        xmutil loadapp kv260-aa2

   c) After you are done running the application, you can unload the curently loaded AA application
      firmware by running:

        xmutil unloadapp

3. How to run application:
    a) Prerequisites:
       i)  Monitor:
           This application needs 4K monitor, so that up to 4 channels of 1080p video could be displayed.
           Before booting the board, please connect the monitor to the board via either DP or HDMI port.
       ii) Enable the 4K display:
           Run following command in terminal:
             modetest -M xlnx -D 80000000.v_mix -s 52@40:3840x2160@NV16
           This step may be removed later.

    b) Setup RTSP server:
       i) IP camera always has configuration to work as RTSP server. Please find the instruction for your IP camera. 
       ii) Get the RTSP server url such as "rtsp://ip-adress:port/name" to be used in next step.
    c) Run AA2 application:
       i)  Run one channel with one process:
            aibox_aa2 -s rtsp://192.168.33.123:5000/test -t rtsp -p 0 
       ii) Run multiple channels together with one process:
            aibox_aa2 -s rtsp://192.168.33.123:5000/test -t rtsp -p 2 
                      -s /usr/share/somapp/movies/AA2/AA2-shop.nv12.30fps.1080p.h264 -t file -p 1
       Only one aibox_aa2 process could be actually running, because it requires locked access to DPU, and there is just one in aibox platform.

4. Known Limitations or issues under debug:
       i)   When you use smartcam_aa1 as file based RTSP server as 3.b)i) states or use file type source, because the video file is played in an infinite loop,
            you may notice that when a new loop starts the tracking ID of the same person will change to a new one. This is not the algorithm issue or bug, but 
            because the algorithm will take the motion trail of the object into account, so a sudden change of scene will cause the generation of the new ID.
       ii)  Stream may freeze after some time if you use this SOM as RTSP server as 3.b)i) and leave AA2 application running for extended period of time.
       iii) After loading AA2 bitstream and dtbo in step 3.a)ii), you should see blue screen on monitor. Sometimes the expected blue screen does not show. To fix 
            this, unplug and replug the DP/HDMI cable.
       iv)  When multiple streams are active, the image displayed can be laggy. 
       
5. Command Option:
   Usage:
     aibox_aa2 [OPTION?] - AI Application of pedestrian + reid + tracking for multi RTSP streams, on SoM board of Xilinx.
